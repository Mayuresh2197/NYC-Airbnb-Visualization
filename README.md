Tableau workbook to visualize the spread of Airbnb in New York City 
 
This is an Exploratory Analysis and Visualization of the Airbnb dataset from New York City. I obtained this dataset from Kaggle, the link to which is: (https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data#New_York_City_.png)
I did not have to perform much of data cleaning as the dataset was already curated. 

Please refer to the workbook for the visuals.
